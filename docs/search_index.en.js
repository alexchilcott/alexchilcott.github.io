a microservice architecture, component testing is a crucial aspect of any comprehensive testing strategy. These tests encourage engineers to treat our services as \"black boxes\" that we can not see inside. We invoke the service's logic only through its public interface and verify its behaviour by observing its subsequent interactions with the world around it.\nWhen we run these services in production, however, we require some degree of observability from them. We must be able to quickly detect when our services' SLIs drop below the SLOs we have set, and then have enough telemetry data to be able to quickly hone in on a root cause.\nThis might seem inconsistent; we treat our services as \"black boxes\" during component testing, but demand observability from them in production.\nIn reality, the observability of the service forms part of its contract with the world around it, in the same way as do its domain-specific APIs.\nIn this post, I'll show a couple of ways we can expand on component tests that exercise domain-specific behaviour of a service to also verify, and therefore prevent regressions in, our service's observability.\n\n\nAll code in this post is written in Rust, and viewable in GitHub. The approaches that are explored are applicable to any language.\nThis post assumes a working knowledge of Prometheus and Jaeger/OpenTelemetry.\n\nOur Cat Service\nLet's define a service, which has an important job to do. It will:\n\nhost a GET /cat route (source), which:\n\nretrieves a cat-related fact from catfact.ninja;\nretrieves a URL of a picture of a cat from thecatapi.com; and\nreturns both to the caller in the form { \"fact\": \"&lt;some fact about cats&gt;\", \"image_url\": \"&lt;url of a cat photo&gt;\" }.\n\n\n\n\n    \n    Our Cat service and its interactions with third-party APIs\n\nRunning our service manually, we can verify that it appears to work.\nHowever, with no tests in place, we are relying on extensive manual testing each time we make a change to verify its behaviour. This is laborious and error-prone.\nOur First Component Test\nTo component test this service, we need to run the service as closely to how it runs in production as possible. Instead of mocking any logic internal to the service in our tests, we will:\n\nstart mocks of any external API our service interacts with;\nconfigure those mocks with their initial state;\ninteract with the service's public API, as a true user of the service would; and\nverify the outcome of that interaction.\n\nEach test for this service will start three HTTP servers - one for the service itself, and one for each of our mocked third-party APIs. The service will be configured with URLs that point to the mocks in place of the URLs that would be used in production for the live APIs.\n\n    \n    A basic component test, exercising our Cat service\n\nA basic component test (source) for this service starts with an Arrange phase, which:\n\nstarts the mocks of the service's dependencies (encapsulated in a TestHarness, for ease of reuse); and\nconfigures the mock to return 200 responses while capturing the image URL and fact that the mocks will return.\n\nlet test_harness = TestHarness::start().await;\nlet cat_image_url = test_harness.mock_cat_images_api.configure_cat_image_url().await;\nlet cat_fact = test_harness.mock_cat_facts_api.configure_cat_fact().await;\n\nDuring the Act phase, we make an HTTP request to the service's /cat endpoint:\nlet response_body = test_harness\n    .client\n    .get(test_harness.build_url(\"/cat\"))\n    .send()\n    .await\n    .expect(\"Failed to make request to server\")\n    .json::&lt;CatFactAndImageUrl&gt;()\n    .await\n    .expect(\"Failed to deserialize body\");\n\nAnd finally, during the Assert phase, we check that the response from the service contains the fact and image URL our mocks were configured to return.\nassert_eq!(response_body.fact, cat_fact);\nassert_eq!(response_body.image_url, cat_image_url);\n\nSo far, so good. We could write various permutations of this test, simulating different error conditions (third-party APIs returning 500s or malformed responses, timeouts, etc.) and call it a day.\nWe are not done yet, though.\nMetrics\nIn our company where we run this service, we use Prometheus to monitor our services, and trigger alerts based on the metrics the service exposes.\nOnce Prometheus discovers a target (in this case, our service), it will, by default, periodically scrape metrics from the service's GET /metrics endpoint. The response has to contain metrics about the service in a format Prometheus understands.\nWe want to be able to trigger an alert when the proportion of GET /cat requests to our service that result in a 500 response breaches a certain threshold. What do we require on our service's public contract to implement this requirement?\n\nOur service should host a GET /metrics endpoint.\nThe response from that endpoint should:\n\ncontain a set of samples in the Prometheus format; and\ninclude a metric called http_requests_total, which counts the number of requests made to the service, and has endpoint, method and status_code labels\n\n\n\nNow we have clarified these requirements, we write tests for them, to give us some confidence that they are met. Without doing so, we risk accidentally changing this behaviour in the future and finding ourselves in an uncomfortable conversation where a client is informing us of degradation to our service before we knew about it ourselves.\nWe define some component test scenarios to protect this behaviour as so:\n\nGiven my service has received a GET /cat request which was handled successfully, when it then receives a GET /metrics request, it should respond with a Prometheus-compatible response that contains an \"http_requests_total\" metric, with \"endpoint\"=\"/cat\", \"method\"=\"GET\", and \"status_code\"=\"200\", whose value is 1.\n\nand\n\nGiven my service has received a GET /cat request which it was unable to handle, when it then receives a GET /metrics request, it should respond with a Prometheus-compatible response that contains an \"http_requests_total\" metric, with \"endpoint\"=\"/cat\", \"method\"=\"GET\", and \"status_code\"=\"500\", whose value is 1.\n\nLet's take a look at the second test (source). Here's what it will do:\n\n    \n    A component test that exercises the metrics reported by our Cat service\n\nFirst, the Arrange phase. We configure our mocks to return 500s, and then we send a GET /cat request to our API, which correctly returns a 500:\nlet test_harness = TestHarness::start().await;\ntest_harness.mock_cat_images_api.setup_failure().await;\ntest_harness.mock_cat_facts_api.setup_failure().await;\n\nlet status_code = test_harness\n    .client\n    .get(test_harness.build_url(\"/cat\"))\n    .send()\n    .await\n    .expect(\"Failed to make request to server\")\n    .status();\nassert_eq!(status_code, StatusCode::INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);\n\nIn our Act phase, we make an HTTP request to our service's /metrics endpoint, just as Prometheus would:\nlet response = test_harness\n    .client\n    .get(test_harness.build_url(\"/metrics\"))\n    .send()\n    .await\n    .expect(\"Failed to make request to server\")\n    .error_for_status()\n    .expect(\"Server returned an error status code\");\n\nAnd finally, during Assert, we parse the response from the /metrics endpoint, and check that it contains the sample we expect:\n// Parse the body of the response from the /metrics endpoint\nlet metrics = parse_metrics_response(response)\n    .await\n    .expect(\"Failed to parse metrics\");\n\n// Then check the `http_requests_total` metric\nlet sample = metrics\n    .samples\n    .iter()\n    .find(|sample| { // &lt;-- this is Rust's closure syntax. This block is a\n                     // predicate function that takes a sample and returns\n                     // `true` if it has the name and labels we are looking\n                     // for.\n        sample.metric == \"http_requests_total\"\n            &amp;&amp; sample.labels.get(\"endpoint\") == Some(\"/cat\")\n            &amp;&amp; sample.labels.get(\"method\") == Some(\"GET\")\n            &amp;&amp; sample.labels.get(\"status\") == Some(\"500\")\n    })\n    .expect(r#\"No matching http_requests_total sample found for \"/cat\" endpoint\"#);\n\nassert_eq!(sample.value, Value::Counter(1.into()));\n\nGreat! We have some confidence that our service will do The Right Thing™ when it comes to the metrics it exports. Assuming the other pieces of the alerting puzzle are working (a big assumption, the testing of which is outside the scope of this post), our brave oncallers will be awoken from their slumber when our service's error rate breaches the alerting threshold we set. Bleary-eyed, our oncaller heads to our tracing UI to begin to triage...\nOh. The service's traces aren't correct...\nTraces\nTraces, like metrics, are often something that engineers get working in their service, check manually once the service is deployed to a test environment, and then call it a day. Unfortunately, also like metrics, if we inadvertently break this behaviour and do not have tests in place that catch this for us, we risk noticing only at the worst possible time; during an incident.\nFor our service, let's imagine a relatively simple configuration for exporting traces. Our service will send traces, in the Jaeger format, to a Jaeger-compatible collector, such as the OpenTelemetry collector. From there it will be exported to whichever backends we use to visualize our traces. Sampling of traces will be handled by the collector.\n\n    \n    Exporting traces from our services to an OpenTelemetry collector\n\nCrystallising this design into some concrete requirements, we will say for every HTTP request our service handles, it should:\n\nEventually send a trace to the collector, using the Jaeger API.\nThe trace should be named HTTP request.\nThe trace should contain http.status_code, http.method, and http.route tags.\n\nWith a bit of work to build a mock collector that can receive our spans and store them in memory for later querying, we can begin to verify this behaviour of our service rather nicely through our tests.\nWe will define a component test to verify our traces as so:\n\nGiven my service has received a GET /cat request which was handled successfully, then eventually, the collector should receive a trace for this request. This trace should contain a span whose operation name is HTTP request, and should have a tags for http.status_code, http.method and http.route whose values are 200, GET, and /cat respectively.\n\n\"Eventually\"? What's that about?\nWe are testing asynchronous behaviour. In production, traces are typically batched by the service and sent asynchronously to the collector. This is by design, to prevent delays or failures in pushing traces resulting in the degradation of our service, and to reduce the chattiness of our service when sending traces over the network. However, this introduces uncertainty into our tests.\nTo overcome this, we might choose to run our service in a \"test mode\" to make this behaviour synchronous for our tests, but this increases the room for bugs that only manifest themselves in \"non-test-mode\" to slip into our service.\nDepending on the language and ecosystem you are using to build your service, and the extent to which your test logic is able to trigger behaviour inside your service, there may be nice ways to minimise this delay. For example, the OpenTelemetry SDK specification describes a ForceFlush method. While triggering this from tests would cross the boundary between the service logic and the test logic, rather than strictly testing the service only through its public API, it is worth considering to keep your tests running quickly and reliably.\nHowever, even if we do manually flush any pending spans, there may still be a small delay before we can query these from our mock collector. Flushing the spans is not necessarily synchronous.\nSo, we pick a timeout to allow for the traces our mock collector has received to eventually match the expectations in our tests. The longer the timeout, the longer it may take broken tests to fail, but the lower the risk of false negatives, where the service behaviour is correct but our timeout was just too short. It usually makes sense to optimise for non-flaky tests, and choose a generous timeout.\nAs in our first test, we set up our HTTP request to succeed inside the Arrange phase (source):\nlet test_harness = TestHarness::start().await;\ntest_harness.mock_cat_images_api.configure_cat_image_url().await;\ntest_harness.mock_cat_facts_api.configure_cat_fact().await;\n\nDuring Act, we:\n\nopen a span;\nmake an HTTP request to GET /cat, propagating our current tracing context inside the request; and\ncapture the trace ID from the span we created.\n\nlet trace_id = {\n    let test_span =\n        info_span!(\"cat_endpoint_sends_a_trace_that_shows_the_incoming_http_request\");\n    test_harness\n        .client\n        .get(test_harness.build_url(\"/cat\"))\n        .send()\n        .instrument(test_span.clone())\n        .await\n        .expect(\"Failed to make request to server\")\n        .error_for_status()\n        .expect(\"Expected a success response\");\n\n    test_span.otel_trace_id()\n};\n\nFinally, in our Assert phase, we:\n\nquery our collector to retrieve the trace;\ncheck the trace has a span with the correct name; and\ncheck the span has the correct tags.\n\nSince the behaviour is asynchronous, we retry until it either succeeds or a timeout elapses:\nwait_10_seconds_for_trace(\n    test_harness.jaeger_collector_server,\n    trace_id.clone(),\n    |trace| { // This block is a function that will run every time we want to make\n              // assertions against the current state of the trace. The\n              // wait_10_seconds_for_trace function polls our mock collector's\n              // in-memory collection of traces and terminates once a trace exists\n              // that passes all the expectations below.\n        let span_node = trace\n            .descendants()\n            .find(|s| s.borrow().operation_name == \"HTTP request\")\n            .ok_or_else(|| anyhow!(r#\"No span found named \"HTTP request\"\"#))?;\n\n        check_tag(&amp;span_node, \"http.method\", TagValue::String(\"GET\"))\n            .context(\"span method was not correct\")?;\n        check_tag(&amp;span_node, \"http.route\", TagValue::String(\"/cat\"))\n            .context(\"span route was not correct\")?;\n        check_tag(&amp;span_node, \"http.status_code\", TagValue::Long(200))\n            .context(\"span status code was not correct\")\n    },\n)\n.await\n.expect(\"Expected trace was not available within timeout\");\n\nIf you are worried this looks like a painfully slow test to run, worry not!\nrunning 1 test\ntest tests::cat_endpoint_sends_a_trace_that_shows_the_incoming_http_request ... ok\n\ntest result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 4 filtered out; finished in 0.01s\n\nSuccess! From this starting point, we can build up much richer tests that check many details about any traces we publish, and therefore, the information that will be available during incidents for debugging. For example:\n\nDo our spans have the correct domain-specific tags that we want to enrich them with, such as user_id?\nDo we add correlation IDs for our third-party API calls to their spans?\nDo we capture useful details of errors on spans for calls that failed?\n\nTests such as these will give us much more confidence that our traces will look as we expect them to, when we need to rely on them.\nWrapping Up\nSo, where do we stand now?\nThere is still much that could go awry. Misconfigured network policies may block traffic between our service and our observability tooling. Our PromQL expressions for our alerts or dashboard panels might not be correct. Our PagerDuty configuration might not be as we expected it to be.\nHowever, by considering our service's observability requirements in terms of its specific interactions with the world around it, we have been able to exercise that behaviour through component testing. We have bought ourselves some confidence in our service's observability today, and some protection against regressions tomorrow.\n","id":"https://alexchilcott.github.io/posts/when-is-a-black-box-test-not-a-black-box-test/","title":"When Is A \"Black Box\" Test Not A \"Black Box\" Test?"}},"docInfo":{"https://alexchilcott.github.io/":{"body":4,"title":2},"https://alexchilcott.github.io/posts/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://alexchilcott.github.io/posts/when-is-a-black-box-test-not-a-black-box-test/":{"body":1246,"title":6}},"length":3},"lang":"English"};
