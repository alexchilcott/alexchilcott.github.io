a microservice architecture, component testing, where the behaviour of a service is verified using only what is invokable and observable through its public interface, has become a crucial aspect of any comprehensive testing strategy. These tests encourage engineers to treat the service as a \"black box\" that we can not see inside, and focus purely on the service's contract with the world around it.\nWhen these services are deployed to production, however, we require some degree of observability from them. The failure modes of complex distributed systems are rarely predictable, so it is crucial that, when our system's SLIs drop below the SLOs we have set for it, our services that comprise that system are exporting the telemetry data that engineers need to be able to detect and diagnose the problem.\nWe treat our services as \"black boxes\" during component testing, but demand that, once in production, the service provides some visibility of its internals. This seems inconsistent, until we begin to consider the behaviour of the service that enables this observability as just as much a part of its contract with the world around it as are the APIs that expose its domain-specific behaviour.\nIn this post, I'll show a couple of ways we can expand on component tests that exercise domain-specific behaviour of a service, to also verify, and therefore prevent regressions to, our service's observability behaviour.\n\n\nAll code in this post is written in Rust, and viewable in GitHub. The approaches that are explored are applicable to any language.\nThis post assumes a working knowledge of Prometheus and Jaeger/OpenTelemetry.\n\nOur Cat Service\nLet's define a microservice, which has an important job to do. It hosts a /cat route (source), which returns a random cat fact and image url. It gets these by making HTTP requests out to a couple of third party APIs; the example code uses catfact.ninja and thecatapi.com respectively.\n\n    \n    Our Cat service and its interactions with third party APIs\n\nRunning our service manually, we can verify that it appears to work. However, without any tests for this service, we are relying on extensive manual testing each time we make a change to verify the existing behaviour has not changed, and any new behaviour is as we expect it to be. This sounds laborious and error prone, to me.\nOur First Component Test\nTo component test this service, we would aim to run the service as closely to how it runs in production as possible. Instead of mocking any logic internal to the service's boundary, we build a test environment inside our tests which mocks out any of the service's points of contact with the outside world. We would then verify the behaviour of the service by interacting with it as a genuine client of the service would; through its public HTTP API.\nEach test for this service will start 3 HTTP servers - one for the Cat service itself, and one for each third party API our service depends on that we need to mock. The Cat service will be configured with URLs that point to the third party mocks in place of the URLs that would be used in production for the genuine APIs.\n\n    \n    A basic component test, exercising our Cat service\n\nA basic component test (source) for this service might start with an Arrange phase, which starts some form of test harness, containing our service and any mocks of dependencies it requires, then configures the mock APIs to return 200 responses and captures the image and fact that our mocks will return.:\nlet test_harness = TestHarness::start().await;\nlet cat_image_url = test_harness\n    .mock_cat_images_api\n    .configure_cat_image_url()\n    .await;\nlet cat_fact = test_harness.mock_cat_facts_api.configure_cat_fact().await;\n\nDuring the Act phase, it can then make an HTTP request to our service:\nlet response_body = test_harness\n    .client\n    .get(test_harness.build_url(\"/cat\"))\n    .send()\n    .await\n    .expect(\"Failed to make request to server\")\n    .json::&lt;CatFactAndImageUrl&gt;()\n    .await\n    .expect(\"Failed to deserialize body\");\n\nAnd finally during our Assert phase, it can check the response from the server contains the data our mocks were configured to return.\nassert_eq!(response_body.fact, cat_fact);\nassert_eq!(response_body.image_url, cat_image_url);\n\nSo far, so good. We could write various permutations of this test, simulating different error conditions (third party APIs returning 500s or malformed responses, timeouts, etc.) and call it a day.\nWe are not done yet, though.\nMetrics\nIn our company where we run this service, we use Prometheus to monitor our services, and trigger alerts based on the metrics the service exposes.\nLet's say that we want to be able to trigger an alert when the proportion of GET /cat requests to our service that result in a 500 response breaches a certain threshold. What do we require on our service's public contract to implement this requirement?\nOnce Prometheus discovers a target (in this case, our service), it will, by default, periodically scrape metrics from the service's GET /metrics endpoint. The response has to contain metrics about the service in a format Prometheus recognises. We would like our service to export a metric called http_requests_total, and it should have endpoint, method and status_code labels.\nNow we have clarified these requirements, we should write tests for them, to give us some confidence that they are met (and that we do not accidentally change this behaviour in the future), lest we find ourselves in an uncomfortable conversation where a client informs us of degradation to our service before we have noticed ourselves, because we depend on our metrics to trigger alerts, but we inadvertently stopped exporting them correctly.\nWe might define some component test scenarios to protect this behaviour as so:\n\nGiven my server has received a GET /cat request which was handled successfully, when it then receives a GET /metrics request, it should respond with a Prometheus-compatible response that contains an \"http_requests_total\" metric, with \"endpoint\"=\"/cat\", \"method\"=\"GET\", and \"status_code\"=\"200\", whose value is 1.\n\nand\n\nGiven my server has received a GET /cat request which it was unable to handle, when it then receives a GET /metrics request, it should respond with a Prometheus-compatible response that contains an \"http_requests_total\" metric, with \"endpoint\"=\"/cat\", \"method\"=\"GET\", and \"status_code\"=\"500\", whose value is 1.\n\nLet's take a look at the second test (source). Here's what it will do:\n\n    \n    A component test that exercises the metrics reported by our Cat service\n\nFirst, the Arrange phase. We configure our mocks to return 500s, and then we send a GET /cat request to our API, which correctly returns a 500:\nlet test_harness = TestHarness::start().await;\ntest_harness.mock_cat_images_api.setup_failure().await;\ntest_harness.mock_cat_facts_api.setup_failure().await;\n\nlet status_code = test_harness\n    .client\n    .get(test_harness.build_url(\"/cat\"))\n    .send()\n    .await\n    .expect(\"Failed to make request to server\")\n    .status();\nassert_eq!(status_code, StatusCode::INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);\n\nIn our Act phase, we make a request to our service's /metrics endpoint, just as Prometheus would:\nlet response = test_harness\n    .client\n    .get(test_harness.build_url(\"/metrics\"))\n    .send()\n    .await\n    .expect(\"Failed to make request to server\")\n    .error_for_status()\n    .expect(\"Server returned an error status code\");\n\nAnd finally, during Assert, we parse the response from the /metrics endpoint, and check that it contains the sample we expect:\n// Parse the body of the response from the /metrics endpoint\nlet metrics = parse_metrics_response(response)\n    .await\n    .expect(\"Failed to parse metrics\");\n\n// Then check the `http_requests_total` metric\nlet sample = metrics\n    .samples\n    .iter()\n    .find(|sample| { // &lt;-- this is Rust's closure syntax. This block is a\n                     // predicate function that takes a sample and returns\n                     // `true` if it has the name and labels we are looking\n                     // for.\n        sample.metric == \"http_requests_total\"\n            &amp;&amp; sample.labels.get(\"endpoint\") == Some(\"/cat\")\n            &amp;&amp; sample.labels.get(\"method\") == Some(\"GET\")\n            &amp;&amp; sample.labels.get(\"status\") == Some(\"500\")\n    })\n    .expect(r#\"No matching http_requests_total sample found for \"/cat\" endpoint\"#);\n\nassert_eq!(sample.value, Value::Counter(1.into()));\n\nGreat! We have some confidence that our service will do The Right Thing™ when it comes to the metrics it exports. Assuming the other pieces of the alerting puzzle are working (a big assumption, and the testing of which is outside the scope of this post), our brave oncallers will be awoken from their slumber when our service's error rate breaches the alerting threshold we set. Bleary-eyed, our oncaller heads to our tracing UI to begin to triage...\nOh. The service's traces aren't correct...\nTraces\nTraces, like metrics, are often something that engineers get working in their service, check manually once the service is deployed to a test environment, and then call it a day. Unfortunately, also like metrics, if we inadvertently break this behaviour and do not have tests in place that catch this for us, we risk noticing only at the worst possible time; during an incident.\nFor our service, let's imagine a relatively simple configuration for exporting traces. Our service will send traces, in the Jaeger format, to a Jaeger-compatible collector, such as the OpenTelemetry collector. From there it will be exported to whichever backends we use to visualize our traces.\n\n    \n    Exporting traces from our services to an OpenTelemetry collector\n\nSo what is our service's contract here? For any request it receives, it should eventually send a trace (consisting of a number of spans) for the request to our collector, using the Jaeger API. (We are assuming sampling of traces is performed outside the service, and so traces for all requests are sent.)\nWe might also want to define some properties of the trace; perhaps there are company-wide standards that we want all services to adhere to. For example, for spans representing an HTTP request being handled by a server, they should be named HTTP request and contain http.status_code, http.method, and http.route tags.\nWith a bit of work to build a mock collector that can receive our spans and store them in memory for later querying, we can begin to verify this behaviour of our service rather nicely through our tests.\nWe will define a component test to verify our traces as so:\n\nGiven my server has received a GET /cat request which was handled successfully, then eventually, the collector should receive a trace for this request. This trace should contain a span whose operation name is HTTP request, and should have a tag called http.status_code whose value is 200.\n\n\"Eventually\"? What's that about?\nWe are testing asynchronous behaviour. In production, traces are typically batched by the service and sent asynchronously to the collector. This is by design, to prevent delays or failures in pushing traces resulting in the degradation of our service, and to reduce the chattiness of our service when sending traces over the network. However, this introduces uncertainty into our tests. To overcome this, we might choose to run our service in a \"test mode\" to make this behaviour synchronous for our tests, but this increases the room for bugs that only manifest themselves in \"non-test-mode\" to slip into our service.\nDepending on the language and ecosystem you are using to build your service, and the extent to which your test logic is able to trigger behaviour inside your service, there may be nice ways to minimise this delay. For example, the OpenTelemetry SDK specification describes a ForceFlush method. While triggering this from tests would cross the boundary between the service logic and the test logic, rather than strictly testing the service only through its public API, it is worth considering to keep your tests running quickly and reliably.\nHowever, even if we do trigger a forced flush of any pending spans, there may still be a small delay before we can query these from our mock collector. Flushing the spans is not necessarily a synchronous operation. So, we pick a timeout for our tests to allow for traces in our mock to match our expectations. The longer the timeout, the longer it may take genuinely broken tests to fail, but the lower the risk of false negatives, where the service behaviour is correct but our timeout was just too short. It usually makes sense to optimise for non flaky tests, and choose a generous timeout.\nAs in our first test, we set up our HTTP request to succeed inside the Arrange phase (source):\nlet test_harness = TestHarness::start().await;\ntest_harness\n    .mock_cat_images_api\n    .configure_cat_image_url()\n    .await;\ntest_harness.mock_cat_facts_api.configure_cat_fact().await;\n\nDuring Act, we open a span, then make the HTTP request to GET /cat, propagating our current tracing context in the HTTP request we send to the server. We capture the trace's ID from the span we created, to query later from our mock collector:\nlet trace_id = {\n    let test_span =\n        info_span!(\"cat_endpoint_sends_a_trace_that_shows_the_incoming_http_request\");\n    test_harness\n        .client\n        .get(test_harness.build_url(\"/cat\"))\n        .send()\n        .instrument(test_span.clone())\n        .await\n        .expect(\"Failed to make request to server\")\n        .error_for_status()\n        .expect(\"Expected a success response\");\n\n    test_span.otel_trace_id()\n};\n\nFinally, in our Assert phase, we query our collector to retrieve the trace, and check the trace against our expectations. Since it is asynchronous, we retry for a period of time (in this case, up to 10 seconds) until it succeeds:\nwait_for_trace(\n    test_harness.global_jaeger_collector_server,\n    trace_id.clone(),\n    |trace| { // This block is a function that will run every time we want to make\n              // assertions against the current state of the trace. The\n              // wait_for_trace function polls our in-memory collection of traces\n              // and terminates once the trace passes all the expectations below.\n        let span_node = trace\n            .descendants()\n            .find(|s| s.borrow().operation_name == \"HTTP request\")\n            .ok_or_else(|| anyhow!(r#\"No span found named \"HTTP request\"\"#))?;\n\n        check_tag(&amp;span_node, \"http.method\", TagValue::String(\"GET\"))\n            .context(\"span method was not correct\")?;\n        check_tag(&amp;span_node, \"http.route\", TagValue::String(\"/cat\"))\n            .context(\"span route was not correct\")?;\n        check_tag(&amp;span_node, \"http.status_code\", TagValue::Long(200))\n            .context(\"span status code was not correct\")\n    },\n)\n.await\n.expect(\"Expected trace was not available within timeout\");\n\nIf you are worried this looks like a painfully slow test to run, worry not!\nrunning 1 test\ntest tests::cat_endpoint_sends_a_trace_that_shows_the_incoming_http_request ... ok\n\ntest result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 4 filtered out; finished in 0.01s\n\nSuccess! From this starting point, we can build up much richer tests that check many details about any traces we publish, and therefore, the information that will be available during incidents for debugging. Are all the spans we expect to be able to see in our tooling being exported properly? Do they have the correct domain-specific tags that we might want to enrich them with? When our HTTP requests to our third party APIs fail, are details of the failures available as tags on the span?\nTests such as these will give us much more confidence that our traces will look as we expect them to look, when we need to rely on them.\nWrapping Up\nSo, where do we stand now?\nOur cat service has component tests which validate its domain-specific behaviour. On top of that, we can also validate, and prevent regressions to, the metrics it exposes and the traces it sends to our collector. When our requirements change for the metrics and/or traces (perhaps we want to begin to expose some new data on spans for outgoing HTTP requests), we can even implement those requirements in a test driven manner.\nOf course, there is still much that could go awry. Misconfigured network policies may block traffic between our service and our observability tooling. Our PromQL expressions for our alerts or dashboard panels might not be correct. Our PagerDuty configuration might not be as we expected it to be. We can't rely entirely on tests such as these to prove our alerts will fire or our dashboards will be correct, but they can be useful to mitigate the risk of regressions to essential functionality, that is often neglected in our automated tests.\n","id":"https://alexchilcott.github.io/posts/when-is-a-black-box-test-not-a-black-box-test/","title":"When Is A \"Black Box\" Test, Not A \"Black Box\" Test?"}},"docInfo":{"https://alexchilcott.github.io/":{"body":4,"title":2},"https://alexchilcott.github.io/posts/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://alexchilcott.github.io/posts/when-is-a-black-box-test-not-a-black-box-test/":{"body":1333,"title":6}},"length":3},"lang":"English"};
